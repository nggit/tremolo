# Example Applications

This folder contains example applications and code snippets demonstrating the use of **Tremolo**.
Each example may have a different license, which should be specified in the file itself or in an accompanying `LICENSE` file if the example is in a subfolder.

Unless otherwise stated, examples are provided **as-is**, without warranty of any kind.
Please check individual files for licensing details before using them in your projects.

**By contributing to this folder, you agree that your example may be modified, improved, or fixed by others if necessary.
If an example becomes outdated, broken, or no longer relevant, it may also be removed to keep the repository up to date.**
